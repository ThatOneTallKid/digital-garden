title: ðŸŒ± Welcome to My Digital Garden
---


Hello! Iâ€™m Aditya, and this is my **digital garden** â€” a living collection of notes, ideas, and musings that grow and change over time.

Unlike a traditional blog, this garden is **always a work in progress**. Some notes are well-developed, some are just seeds of thoughts. Feel free to explore, get lost, and connect the dots.

# ðŸŒ± About Me

Iâ€™m **Aditya Das**, a curious developer, occasional team leader, avid football fan, and unapologetic sneakerhead.

For the past **2 years at [Increff](https://www.increff.com/)**, Iâ€™ve been building and scaling high-performance systems that power large-scale retail operations. Increff is a trusted retail SaaS company helping global fashion brands and marketplaces manage inventory smartly and fulfill orders efficiently â€” and being part of that mission has taught me a ton about engineering for scale and reliability.

Here in my digital garden, Iâ€™m planting and pruning ideas I pick up along the way â€” from **system design insights** to lessons in **leading projects and teams**, to the occasional note on football tactics or my ever-growing sneaker wishlist.

I believe learning should be visible and messy â€” so feel free to wander through my half-finished thoughts, follow the connections, and maybe leave me a note if something resonates.

**Off the grid:** If Iâ€™m not coding or writing here, Iâ€™m probably chasing a football or hunting down my next pair of kicks.

ðŸŒ¿ _Welcome to my garden. Happy exploring!_
